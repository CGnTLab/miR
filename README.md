# **Batch Correction and Differential Gene Expression**

This repository contains code for performing batch correction and identifying differentially expressed genes in gene expression data.

## Batch Correction
The `batch_correction.R` script provides functionality for correcting batch effects in gene expression datasets. Batch effects can be a confounding factor in large-scale studies, and this script aims to mitigate their impact on downstream analyses.

## Differential Gene Expression

The `DESeq2.R` script is designed to identify genes that are differentially expressed between two or more conditions. This is crucial for understanding the biological significance of gene expression changes.
