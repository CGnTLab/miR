# **Batch Correction and Differential Gene Expression**

This repository contains code for performing batch correction and identifying differentially expressed genes in gene expression data.

## Batch Correction
The `batch_correction.R` script provides functionality for correcting batch effects in gene expression datasets. Batch effects can be a confounding factor in large-scale studies, and this script aims to mitigate their impact on downstream analyses.

### Usage
```bash
Rscript batch_correction.R --input_data data.csv --batch_column batch_info --output_data corrected_data
